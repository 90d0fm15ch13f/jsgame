TODO:
1) Literally all of the css
2) Add 2nd human player
  - including the option to choose between human and cpu 2nd player
3) Make improvments as needed
4) Add time/score display and limit

CSS3 things:
-Super cool game name animation when the page loads
-Gradient background
-Text shadow on scoreboard 


Nifty features that were hard to implement:
-Having the player be able to move in both the x and y directions was tough to implement but makes the game more fun and interactive for the player
-Having the name of the game go back and forth at the begnning took a look of tweaking to get just right


Why our project is worth 100pts:
	Our project is worth 100pts due to a rather complex javascript file as well as asethically pleasing CSS styling.
