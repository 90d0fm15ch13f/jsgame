CSS3 things:
-Super cool game name animation when the page loads
-Gradient background
-Text shadow on scoreboard 


Nifty features that were hard to implement:
-Having the player be able to move in both the x and y directions was tough to implement but makes the game more fun and interactive for the player
-Having the name of the game go back and forth at the begnning took a look of tweaking to get just right


Why our project is worth 100pts:
	Our project is worth 100pts due to a rather complex javascript file as well as asethically pleasing CSS styling. Implementing a computer player that was skilled enough to make the game interesting was also a challange. This group project has taken us at least as much time and effort as previous assignments in the course, and we learned from eachothers strengths. We believe that this project is a good representation of our front end development skills.
